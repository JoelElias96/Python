# Python
Projects from python course in Udemy
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python repository, where I dive deep into the Python programming language, one day at a time. This repo is a collection of projects, challenges, and coding exercises that span various topics in Python, helping me sharpen my skills and explore new domains in software development.

About the Journey
This repository is a chronicle of my progress through 100 days of coding, focusing on Python, a versatile language that powers everything from web applications to data science and automation. Each day represents a step forward in solving real-world problems, implementing algorithms, and building functional programs.

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, you’ll find something of interest—from small scripts to more elaborate projects.

What You’ll Find Here
Daily Coding Challenges: A mix of problem-solving exercises and coding challenges aimed at strengthening the core Python skills.

Mini Projects: Fun and practical mini-projects that solve real-world problems or automate everyday tasks.

Tools & Techniques: Examples of how to leverage Python libraries and frameworks, such as requests, pandas, flask, and many more.

Algorithm & Data Structures: Solutions to algorithmic challenges, exploring data structures, recursion, sorting algorithms, and more.

Interactive Projects: Some days feature interactive programs that you can run directly to experience the results.

Technologies & Tools
